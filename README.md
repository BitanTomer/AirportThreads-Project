# AirportThreads-Project
Airport project - Build and maintains airport project using OOP, multi-threading, collections and Database.

Different flights depart and land at runways at the airport. There are a total of 3 routes with a person directing the aircraft on each route. Airplanes without a free route are waiting in the ground/in the air, and there is priority for landings flights. Each flight that landed leaves the route and moves to wait for cargo unloading by a logistics team, when there is a total of 3 crews in the airport. After unloading the cargo, the landed flights are waiting for a security check by a security guard in the airport (there are 2 security guards). After the security check, the landed flights await the refueling team (there are 2 refueling teams). At the end of the process, approval is required from the management team of the airport (there is only one team) which records the details of the landed or departed flights. In some cases, malfunctions occur, and post-landing flights require technical care. The fault detection can occur immediately after the flight arrives to the airport, after unloading, or after refueling. In these cases the flights stop and do not proceed to the next stage, waiting for one of the existing technical teams in the airport. After receiving technical treatment, they can proceed with the process to the next level. Departures flights depart at runways at the airport and do not go through additional process. the flight details are forwarded to the airport management team for documentation.
